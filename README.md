Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project

The original scope of this project was to create a basic console-based rock paper scissors game. This was the first Javascript project as part of The Odin Project's corriculum.

Later on, the corriculum revisited this project to add a user interface, rather than a console-based game.
